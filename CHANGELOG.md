### Added

- Splat `...` operator — merge arrays/objects with `...=a=1,b=2`
- Arguments now set attributes via `:/example=foo/`
- JSON input format for arrays and objects with `[:json]` / `{:json}`
  - Allows merging JSON documents into properties or the host with `...`
- Missing/empty value handling
  - Missing files / unset variables can be treated as empty inputs using `~`
    flag
  - Arguments with empty inputs can substitute default values using `?` flag
  - Arguments with empty inputs can be omitted using `??` flag
  - Arguments can enforce non-empty inputs using `+` flag
- Alpine linux is supported
- Container image `ghcr.io/h4l/json.bash/jb`
- OS packages
  - Currently meta-published via a container image that can build many package
    formats: `ghcr.io/h4l/json.bash/pkg`

### Fixed

- Validator coprocess no longer closes process substitution file descriptors
  when starting
- Validator coprocess no longer times out sporadically when reading validation
  results
